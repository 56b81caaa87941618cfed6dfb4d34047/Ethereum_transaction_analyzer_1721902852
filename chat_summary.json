Initially, the user requested the addition of a button labeled \"How are you,\" with subsequent queries from the AI about its placement and functionality - whether to place it in the top navigation bar or as a floating button at the bottom, and whether clicking it should open a feedback form or display mood options. Similarly, the user wanted another button added, saying \"Hey there,\" with questions from the AI regarding its position relative to an existing 'Hello World' button and whether it should maintain the same style or adopt a new one. The AI also inquired about the placement and function of the 'Hello World' button, with options for its position (top or bottom of the home screen, center of the main screen, or bottom right corner) and triggered functionality (displaying a message or navigating to a new page).\n\nAdditionally, the user was presented with lists of potential features to include in the app, such as a dark/light mode toggle, real-time transaction notifications, a detailed analysis page for transactions, graphs displaying transaction trends, and filter options for sorting transactions. Secure user authentication and a customizable dashboard were also offered as options to enhance user experience.\n\nThe AI's role was to acknowledge and confirm the user's requests for adding the specified buttons and to gather more details about the project, indicating a collaborative effort to refine the app's features according to the user's preferences and the application's requirements.",
